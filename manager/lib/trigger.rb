        Do this Linear issue: #{Linear.url(item)}

        The manager runs this card. Do not use the `interactive-card` skill.

        This may be a new card or a kickback with corrections in later comments. There may already be a worktree, commits, and a PR.

        1. This session is already in the card worktree. Env files and schema.rb were copied from the main checkout.
        2. Rebase onto the current origin main. Do not hard-reset; keep existing commits.
        3. Read the card and all comments.
        4. Implement the work. You may edit existing commits or add new ones.
        5. If you finish:
           - Commit
           - Open a GitHub PR with `gh pr create` using `GITHUB_TOKEN`
           - Link the PR to the card
           - Comment on the card describing what you did
           - Remove the working tag
           - Move the card to review
        6. If the card is blocked or the change is not possible:
           - Comment on the card explaining why
           - Remove the working tag
           - Move the card to planned

        This Linear issue is approved: #{Linear.url(item)}

        The manager runs this card. Do not use the `interactive-card` skill.

        1. Rebase the GitHub PR on the card. Resolve merge conflicts.
        2. Merge the PR with `gh pr merge` using `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
        3. If this session is in the main checkout rather than a worktree, run `mise manager:gotomain`.
        4. Move the card to completed.
        5. Remove the working tag.
